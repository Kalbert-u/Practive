### Introduction:
*  MODAPTS stands for Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards.
*  First database named ‘Concise MODAPTS’ was created in 1966.
*  ‘Office MODAPTS’ or database for clerical time studies created in 1969.
*  Developed by Mr. G. Chris Heyde.

### What is ' MODAPTS'?
* It is a system that relates standard time values to movements of human body.
* Standard time is not the same as “real time”, it refers to “a unit of time
required to do certain work”.
* In MODAPTS ‘these units of time’ are expressed as modules or ‘MODS’.
* The entire system is based on the discovery that all human body movements
can be expressed in terms of single unit of time, called a MOD.
